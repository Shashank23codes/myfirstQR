## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use Flexbox to center elements both vertically and horizontally. Here's an example of the CSS I used:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  padding: 20px;
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 400px;
  text-align: center;
}
```
